Development of <b>@EWS_APP_NAME@</b> was supported by a generous grant
from the <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/corporate_community.html">NVIDIA Foundation</a>.

<p>
The discretized wave equation implementation was derived from the
<a href="http://phet.colorado.edu/simulations/sims.php?sim=Wave_Interference">
PhET Wave Interference Application</a> source code by Sam Reid, University
of Colorado at Boulder.
</p>

<p>
The application was build on the <a href="http://qt.nokia.com/">Qt</a> 
cross-platform application and UI framework, and incorporates 
<a href="http://www.openscenegraph.org/projects/osg">OpenSceneGraph</a> for 3-D rendering.
