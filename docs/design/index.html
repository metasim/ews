<h1>EWS Software Design</h1>

<p>The following UML diagrams an accompanying text describe the high-level
software design for the Educational Wave Simulation (EWS, working title) application.</p>

<h2>System Components</h2>
<p>In the following UML component diagram major system components are shown.
This representation is <b>conceptual</b> and does not imply a class-level design,
but is intended to identify the major third party dependencies and the 
general domain of implementation.
Arrows indicate direction of dependency, and grouping boxes organize related
components as modules:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Qt</b>: Third-party application development platform in C++.</li>
<ul>
<li><b>QtCore</b>: Data-model property support, threading, event management.</li>
<li><b>QtGui</b>: UI components, native desktop abstraction, look and feel.</li>
<li><b>QtOpenGL</b>: Provides and manages basic OpenGL rendering context for 
OpenSceneGraph.</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Rendering</b>: 3-D rendering support</li>
<ul>
<li><b>OpenSceneGraph</b>: Manages OpenGL pipeline with abstractions for
camera, scene object hierarchy, model-view transformations, rendering state, etc.</li>
<li><b>OpenGL</b>: rendering pipeline API</li>
</ul>

<li><b>Simulation</b>: Wave/interference model simulation
<ul>
<li><b>Wave Simulation</b>: Implementation of discretized wave model, heavily
borrowed from <a href="http://phet.colorado.edu/simulations/sims.php?sim=Wave_Interference">PhET implementation</a>.</li>
<li><b>Data Model</b>: Maintains simulation state and coordinates updates
between the data and simulation. Serves as API between the 
<em>User Interface</em> and <em>Simulation</em>
</ul>

<li><b>User Interface</b>: Developed using combination of 
<a href="http://qt.nokia.com/doc/4.6/qt4-designer.html">Qt Designer</a> and Qt subclassing.</li>
<ul>
<li><b>EWS Editors</b>: Forms and standard UI controls allowing user to control
simulation parameters, such as water drop sources, interference barriers, etc.</li>
<li><b>EWS 3-D View</b>: Widget displaying 3-D rendering/animation of simulation
and dispatches user input events to OpenSceneGraph.</li>
</ul>


</ul>
<center><a href="components.png"><img src="components.png" border="1"/></a></center>

<p>The <em>User Interface</em> and <em>Simulation</em> domains are developed
for this project, while <em>Qt</em> and <em>Rendering</em> are provided by
third-party packages (<a href="http://qt.nokia.com">Qt</a> and 
<a href="http://www.openscenegraph.org">OpenSceneGraph</a>).

<h2>Static Class Design</h2>

<p>The following diagrams show the core classes, members, and associations to be
used in implementing EWS. An attempt has been made to balance completeness and
sufficiency, so not all foreseen classes or members are necessarily rendered.
It is believed that the general architecture is sound and sufficient for
implementation.</p>

<p id="badges">Classes in the diagrams below are adorned with glyphs providing some
additional stereotype information:
<ul>
<li><b>C</b>: plain old C++ class</li>
<li><b>A</b>: interface or abstract class</li>
<li><b>O</b>: related to OpenSceneGraph</li>
<li><b>Q</b>: Qt-compliant class, with signal/slot support</li>
<li><b>W</b>: QWidget subclass, aggregating multiple UI components into a single editor.</li>
<li><b>M</b>: Qt/OSG Mix-in. </li>
</ul>

<p>In UML, open arrows indicate inheritance (arrow points to base class). All other
lines indicate association via association, aggregation, or composition, with the 
arrow representing direction of navigability.</p>

<p id="packages">Note: <em>Due to a current limitation in the
diagramming tool used (PlantUML + dot), packages/namespaces whose contents are exposed are 
displayed as a simple box with a thick stroke and white background rather than
the standard package rendering with a tab in the upper left corner.</em></p>


<h3>High-level Classes</h3>

<p id="namespaces">This diagram shows the general high-level relationships between classes,
with the 4 major namespaces represented: </p>
<ul>
<li><b>app</b>: namespace separating the application framework from the 
physics simulation.</li>
<ul>

<li><b><a href="#widget">widget</a></b>: The classes in this namespace are
mainly comprised of forms designed with 
<a href="http://qt.nokia.com/doc/4.6/qt4-designer.html">Qt Designer</a>, the 
generated C++ classes, and associated controller classes. The classes shown in
these diagrams are primarily subclasses of 
<a href="http://qt.nokia.com/doc/4.6/qwidget.html">QWidget</a> that provide
the <a href="http://qt.nokia.com/doc/4.6/signalsandslots.html">signals and slots</a> 
binding to the <a href="http://qt.nokia.com/doc/4.6/qobject.html">QObject</a>-based data 
model to ensure synchronization between the UI and data model</li>

<li><b><a href="#model">model</a></b>: The various simulation parameters and object
abstractions, as they are captured from a user perspective, are contained in
the <tt>app.model</tt> namespace. These classes capture all the application
state at a given time, and are the means of separating the GUI from the
simulation, as well as the 3-D representation from the editing forms.</li>

<li id="dpack"><b><a href="#drawable">drawable</a></b>: 
<a href="http://www.openscenegraph.org">OpenSceneGraph</a> 
provides multiple abstractions for capturing the low-level OpenGL operations
for rendering encapsulated object representations. The classes in the 
<tt>app.drawable</tt> namespace are responsible for representing the simulation
entities in the 3-D scene graph.</li>


</ul>
<li><b><a href="#physics">physics</a></b>: This namespace is completely separate
from the others, with no external dependencies, providing a clean separation
between GUI and simulation.</li>
</ul>

<p>It should be noted that there are effectively three parallel inheritance
hierarchies (four if you count the GUI components) representing different 
yet similar concepts for the different domains. The <tt>app.model</tt> namespace
contains the user data for configuring the simulation. The <tt>physics</tt> 
namespace contains the reinterpretation of those user-parameters in the
simulation domain. The <tt>app.drawable</tt> namespace contains the 3-D geometry
representation. The details of the data sharing between the <tt>Lattice</tt>, 
<tt>WaveMedium</tt>, and <tt>WaterSurfaceGeom</tt> classes
(the respective physics, data model, and scene graph views into the same concept)
are still to be worked out, as we need to minimize the amount of data copying
that occurs while maintaining separation.</p>

<center><a href="toplevel.png"><img src="toplevel.png" border="1"/></a></center>

<p>The details within each of these namespaces are shown in the diagrams
below.</p>

<h3 id="model">Application Data Model Classes</h3>

<p>The classes in this namespace are responsible for storing the simulation
state and propagating change events 
(<a href="http://qt.nokia.com/doc/4.6/signalsandslots.html">signals</a>
in Qt parlance) to registered classes (e.g. <tt>app.drawable</tt>). 
Therefore, he <tt>SimulationState</tt> class and its aggregates provide 
synchronization with the other domains via an Observer/Observed pattern.</p>


<center><a href="app.model.png"><img src="app.model.png" border="1"/></a></center>


<h3 id="widget">GUI Widget Classes</h3>
<p><tt>EWSMainWindow</tt> inherits from 
<tt><a href="http://qt.nokia.com/doc/4.6/qmainwindow.html">QMainWindow</a></tt>, 
which provides a large part of the setup code for maintaining an application's
runtime on the native platform. The editor classes all inherit from 
<tt><a href="http://qt.nokia.com/doc/4.6/qwidget.html">QWidget</a></tt> 
which allows multiple UI components to be laid out in a form and then inserted
into the main window via the 
<a href="http://qt.nokia.com/doc/4.6/qt4-designer.html">Qt Designer</a> tool.</p>

<p id="osgwidget">The <tt>OSGWidget</tt> class deserves special attention. Based on the
<a href="http://www.openscenegraph.org/projects/osg/browser/OpenSceneGraph/trunk/examples/osgviewerQT/osgviewerQT.cpp">osgviewerQT</a> example 
in the OSG distribution, the purpose of this class is to coordinate and synchronize
the Qt event loop, the OSG rendering look, and a common graphics context. 

<center><a href="app.widget.png"><img src="app.widget.png" border="1"/></a></center>

<h3 id="drawable">3-D Drawable Classes</h3>

<p>When the <tt>SimulationState</tt> class is changed in a way that adds or removes
by an object in the simulation (i.e. a new barrier),
it sends a signal to the <tt>SceneRoot</tt> class indicating the change. The 
<tt>SceneRoot</tt> class then sends a request to the <tt>DrawableFactory</tt>
class to instantiate the scene graph representation of that object (on an add),
or removes the association (on a delete) from the scene graph. The 
<tt>DrawableFactory</tt> class encapsulates the mapping or between data model and 
scene graph objects, keeping the coupling between them low.</p>

<p id="adapter">All drawables created by <tt>DrawableFactory</tt> subclass the abstract
base class <tt>DrawableQtAdapter</tt>. This base class provides the convenience facilities 
for synchronizing the scene graph representation with the Qt-based data model, and
with the <tt>DrawableFactory</tt> provides a clean separation between the Qt and
OpenSceneGraph domains. When a GUI action causes a change in a data model object (via <tt>QObject</tt>), 
a change signal is fired and interpreted by the <tt>DrawableQtAdapter</tt>
sub-class (<tt>BarrierGeom</tt>, <tt>FaucetGeom</tt>, etc.) to thereby modify the geometric 
representation.</p>
 
<center><a href="app.drawables.png"><img src="app.drawables.png" border="1"/></a></center>

<h3 id="physics">Wave Physics Classes</h3>

<p>The <tt>physics</tt> namespace is self-contained, with no dependencies
on the other packages. Classes in the <tt>app.model</tt> package will instantiate
and manage references to items in this package, but the <tt>physics</tt> code
is indented to be self-contained and independently testable. The design heavily 
borrows from <a href="http://phet.colorado.edu/simulations/sims.php?sim=Wave_Interference">PhET implementation</a>, 
with minor simplifications. Continued investigation into the physics-level distinction between
"Walls" and "Barriers", as our initial analysis shows there should be no
distinction and the code could be simplified by combining these concepts into
a single model.</p>
