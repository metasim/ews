Very important:
The wave model for water assumes that the period (and hence,
frequency) of the faucet (oscillator) determines the wave length of
the waves in the water. Although this is true for the light analog,
this is just plain wrong for water. The wave length of water is
primarily determined by its depth. (See
http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/waves/u10l3b.cfm for a more
in-depth explanation of this.)

Important:
The physics in general is very approximate, and although it typically
"feels" right, it could stand improvement. For one thing, there are
no units explicitly used, so measurements are only comparative.

Somewhat important:
It would be nice to be able to scale the magnitude of the various
graphs available to us, or at the very least have an option to
auto-scale.
